# Suminagashi MPE Visualizer Engine — agent working rules

The full specification is `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` (spec v2 — it absorbed the
validated v1 decisions). Decision log: `docs/DECISIONS.md` (Part I = v1,
Part II = v2; references written as `DECISIONS_2 #n` mean Part II). History:
`docs/CHANGELOG.md`; the completed roadmap is `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Work items
are fed one at a time by the user.

Working rules (apply to every task):

1. Read the spec sections referenced by the current task before writing code.
   Where the spec and the decision log conflict, the spec wins; flag any
   remaining conflict instead of silently picking one.
2. Keep every sokol call behind `core/src/renderer.cpp` /
   `core/src/swapchain_*.{mm,cpp}`; nothing above those files may include
   sokol headers.
3. No exceptions, no STL types, no callbacks-into-C++ across `sumi_core.h`.
4. Backend purity rule (spec §4.6): the deformation chain never contains
   backend-specific branches; orientation flips live only in the final
   swapchain composite and the print readback path.
5. Prefer the choice that keeps the core identical across all five platforms;
   log every newly resolved ambiguity as a new numbered entry in
   `docs/DECISIONS.md` Part II.
6. The user makes all git commits themselves — agents never commit. Prepare
   DONE evidence under `docs/evidence/<task>/` (transient: evidence folders
   are removed from the tree once a milestone ships — git history keeps them
   — and their SUMMARY.md is condensed into `docs/CHANGELOG.md`), and report
   when the tree is ready, with an evidence reference for the commit message.
7. Do not implement anything from a later planned task early, even if
   convenient.

Build: `cmake -B build -G Ninja && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build`
(Homebrew cmake/ninja live in /opt/homebrew/bin.)
iOS: `cmake -B build-ios -G Ninja -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS
-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=16.0 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF && cmake --build build-ios`, then `cd ios && xcodegen`
and build the generated project. Android: Gradle in `android/` drives the
repo-root CMake via externalNativeBuild.
