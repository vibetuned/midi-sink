# DECISIONS_2

Ambiguities resolved during spec-v2 implementation (v1 history: DECISIONS.md;
where the two conflict, PROJECT_SPEC_2.md wins — it absorbed the validated v1
decisions). Guiding principle: keep the core identical across all five
platforms.

## Step 8

1. **Timeout arming refreshes every voice's activity clock** (§3.1). The
   suspicious window starts AT the overflow — that is when a Note Off may
   have vanished — so held voices get a full ~10 s grace period from that
   moment instead of being expired retroactively for pre-overflow silence.

2. **A refused dip refuses everything** (§5.3): no snapshot, no field reset,
   no counter rebase — the performance continues on the same sheet, with one
   warning log. Both the CC64/event path (voice mapper, `dip_allowed` from
   the engine) and `sumi_trigger_paper_dip` behave identically.

3. **`sumi_read_print` returns the NEWEST ready print and consumes it** (the
   buffer frees for the next dip); a size query (pixels = NULL) does not
   consume. Reading twice after a dip burst therefore yields newest, then
   oldest — the harness burst test saves both.

4. **Ink thickness cannot come from `fract(phase)`**: §4.4 feed-grown regions
   are onion-layered micro-shells (one per emission), so the fractional
   radial oscillates across the region and everything read as "edge". The
   composite instead probes the band at four ±5-texel offsets — same-band
   fraction = thickness. Costs 4 extra field taps in the composite only.

5. **Feed-episode hysteresis**: onset at smoothed press > 0.02, release at
   < 0.008; the first episode continues the strike's band (the §3.4 "drop
   keeps growing" behavior), each later onset takes a fresh counter/band
   seeded at R = 0.004 — that is what stamps §4.4's nested rings. Wind-brush
   episodes reset to the breath-width seed the same way.

## Step 9

6. **Chroma-grid out-of-range notes clamp to the nearest edge ROW, keeping
   their pitch-class column** (spec §3.4 says "nearest edge cell"): a G#0
   lands in the top row's G# column, not in C1's cell — preserving pitch-class
   identity reads better than snapping to the literal nearest cell.

7. **Glide axis = shorter of the two neighbor steps** (pos(note±1)), pointing
   toward increasing pitch. This derives the axis from the ACTIVE layout with
   no per-layout code: grids stay on their row at octave wraps (B->C jumps a
   row, B->A# does not), Jankó picks the half-column stagger, fifths keeps
   its capped chord direction (v1 DECISIONS #30 superseded).

8. **Jankó/chroma density vs drop size**: the spec's Jankó geometry packs 42
   whole-tone columns (~0.02 canvas each) — a full chromatic sweep at normal
   drop radii merges the columns within each echo row (three parallel bands);
   discrete lattice reads require sparse intervals. Evidence includes both
   captures. Layouts 3/4 (rolls) are accepted by the ABI but fall back to
   fifths until step 10.

8b. **Echo sets (spec §3.4 rev): fully-fed triplets.** Jankó stamps all three
   parity rows; the voice owns the echo set for its lifetime, press/glide/
   slide/lift fan out to every echo, the drop counter ticks once per
   VoiceBegin (shared band + aux), and the nominal feed boundary is shared so
   echoes grow in lockstep. Budget accounting is per pass but reservation is
   per SET (all-or-none per frame): merging happens within an echo across
   frames — one echo of a set is never culled while another feeds. Echo order
   is top-to-bottom (rows {0,2,4} / {1,3,5}).

9. **Colinear glide tines partially cancel**: two voices bent oppositely on
   the SAME grid row drag along the same infinite line (Jaffer tines have
   lateral locality via alpha, no longitudinal falloff) and mostly cancel.
   Physically consistent, discovered via a self-cancelling demo; glide
   evidence uses voices on different rows.
